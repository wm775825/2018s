This assignment is to get familiar with some basic Coq verification techniques.

[Here](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/current/lf-current/toc.html) is the html version of the assignment book and [here](https://coq-zh.github.io/SF-zh/) the chinese version which is in progress.

[Here](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/current/lf-current/lf.tgz) is the source code of the whole project.  Your target is to finish `Lists.v`, the fourth file. If you have never used Coq before, you may need to finish `Basics.v` and `Induction.v` before getting start. And the tips on how to compile the project is in `Induction.v`.
